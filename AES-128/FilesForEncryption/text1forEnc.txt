The territory of present-day Bulgaria was first inhabited by early humans as long as 1.6 million years ago. In the Kozarnika cave (in northwest Bulgaria) scholars have discovered the second-oldest traces of humans and their culture in Europe (after Georgia). In the past 100 years of prehistoric research in Bulgaria, many Paleolithic sites related to Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens have been discovered and studied.
